#+title: Python C Import

Dynamic library + header + ctypes = Module like object!

Create C bindings for python automatically with the help of libclang. 

* Examples
  #+begin_src python
    from c_import import loader
    import ctypes

    libc = loader.load("libc.so.6", ["stdio.h", "stdint.h", "math.h", "stdlib.h", "string.h", "time.h"])

    filestream = libc.fopen(b"/tmp/x", b"rw+")
    text = ctypes.create_string_buffer(b"Hello world")
    libc.fwrite(text, len(text), 1, fstream)
    libc.fflush(fstream)
    libc.fclose(fstream)

    libc.fileno(libc.stdin)
    # 1

    libc.fputc(ord('A'), libc.stdout)
    libc.fflush(libc.stdout)
    # A

    libc.abs(-1)
    # 1

    x = libc.div(49, 8)
    x.quot # 6
    x.rem  # 1

    # Abort the process
    libc.abort()
  #+end_src

* How does that work
** The loader calls the c pre-processor to resolve any "include"s and "define"s.
** The resulting header is processed by libclang
** The header parser module converts the parsed header into ctype types.
** The loader wraps symbols with their python ctype.

* Features
** Working
*** DONE Basic C types
*** DONE Functions
*** DONE Pointers
*** DONE Arrays
*** DONE Structs
*** DONE Unions
*** DONE Enums
*** DONE Typedefs
*** DONE Globals
*** DONE Bitfields
*** DONE Forward declarations
*** DONE Anonymous structs
*** DONE Anonymous unions
*** DONE Anonymous enums
*** DONE Typedefs to anonymous types.
*** DONE Nested anonymous types.
*** DONE "Packed" attribute
*** DONE Variadic arguments
** Not implemented yet
*** TODO Non cdecl functions (Important for Win32API)
*** TODO Pre-processor constant integer expressions
    Their declarations are not preserved after the pre-processing.
*** TODO Vector types

* I thought it was python, why am I seeing lisp?

  Hy is sort of a python lisp hybrid.
  Its written like lisp, but its translated during runtime into python.
  It has interoperability with python, the fact that its written in hy
  is abstracted to the end user of the library.
